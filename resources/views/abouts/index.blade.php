                &emsp; The Environmentalist Project brings environmental clubs to Myanmar in order to build awareness of environmental topics, explore present problems of pollution, and develop ways in which the community can address these problems. This generation will someday be the one in charge, so in the future, people will be taking their knowledge about the natural world into account when they make important decisions. We will create volunteers camps to clean around the country. We first start as small where we go around significant places in Yangon. We also have shopping site as a side job where we sell ecofriendly product online. This project is entirely run by volunteers.
